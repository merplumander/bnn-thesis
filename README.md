This is the code repository to my master thesis "A Closer Look at Ensembles as Approximate Bayesian Neural Networks". 


In "core" you can find all model classes and utilities.    
In "notebooks/base-models" there are explanatory examples how to use the models.

If you have questions about the code or the research, feel free to reach out to me through GitHub.
